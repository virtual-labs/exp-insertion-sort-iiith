45 minutes

### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, you will be able to do the following:

   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying Insertion Sort.
   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of Insertion Sort through interactive animations.
   - Compare Insertion Sort with other sorting algorithms and realise Insertion Sort as a stable comparison sorting algorithm.
