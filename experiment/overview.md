### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

  -  [The Notion of Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
  -  [Notion of Time and Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!
### Overview of the Experiment

   - The aim of this experiment is to understand the Insertion Sort algorithm, its Time and Space Complexity, and how it compares against other sorting algorithms.
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
