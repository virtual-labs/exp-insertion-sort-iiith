      "question": "You are given the array [7, 2, 13, 5, 6, 11, 3, '4', 9, 1].  What is the index of '4', given the array begins at index 0?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "8",
        "b": "7",
        "c": "3",
        "d": "4"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "'4' is not at index 8. Remember that the array begins at index 0, not 1",
        "b": "Correct!",
        "c": "'4' is not at index 3. Remember that the array index begins from the left side of the array",
        "d": "'4' is not at index 4. Remember that the value of an element has no correlation to position"

      "question": "If an array of N elements is completely traversed for each element in the array, what is the time complexity of the algorithm?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(1)",
        "b": "O(logN)",
        "c": "O(N)",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect",
        "b": "Incorrect. The algorithm traverses the same amount of elements every iteration, so the algorithm is not logarithmic",
        "c": "Incorrect. The algorithm traverses N elements N times.",
        "d": "Correct, this is a quadratic time complexity algorithm."

        "c": "[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]",
        "d": "Depends on which data structure is used"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The array must be sorted in an ascending(Increasing) order ",
        "b": "Incorrect. The sorted array should have the same number of elements as the given array.",
        "c": "Correct!",
        "d": "Incorrect. While different data structures sort the data differently, their end results are identical"
